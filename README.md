# rust_compiler


Simple rust compiler in C language that compiles rust code to machine language(MIPS).

Doesn't work with mutable variables and functions.

To compile run the "make clean all" command and to execute run the "./interpreter example1.txt" command.

To see the mips code use the "cat mipscode.txt" command
